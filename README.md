# Bootstrap Express
A quick and easy way to set up a new Express app with a few extras.

Comes pre-configured with Babel, ESLint, and Nodemon. Will continue to add on to this as I find more features!

I've also disabled the default server-side template rendering, this is just meant to be a middleware API.
